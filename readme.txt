 FontDesigner
==============

FontDesigner is a free (GPL3) tool for creating fonts to be used with C programs.
It can save in its own format, or export to .h files.

It can create both 16x16 (2KiB) fonts, or 32x32 (8KiB) fonts.

This is no longer under active development.

INSTALLATION:
Copy the .py file to a directory in your PATH. Optionally remove the ".py" extension.

REQUIREMENTS:
- A monitor, with at least 800x600 resolution. (Preferably higher, as this app is 800px wide.)
- A window manager or desktop environment
- Python 3.7
- Pygame

CHANGELOG:
	Version 1.0.1:
		+ Added lines to make it easier to copy 16x16 fonts into 32x32 fonts

	Version 1.0.0:
		+ Initial Release
